With the flexibility to handle content generation, semantic search, and classification, our API offers a comprehensive solution for your needs.

## Models

We are proud to offer a suite of AI models that are built upon the foundation of four core
models. These models have been carefully developed to offer a range of capabilities in processing both images and text, allowing users to leverage the power of AI to unlock new insights and achieve better outcomes.

Our image processing models include ImageCon, which offers advanced image composition and face generation capabilities, and ImageEnhance, which enhances the quality and detail of images, making them clearer and more visually appealing.

For text processing, we offer AiCon, a powerful model that generates high-quality, coherent text
from prompts, and categorizes text into predefined categories, enabling users to quickly and accurately classify and analyze large volumes of text data.

All of our models are built on a foundation of cutting-edge AI techniques and are designed to be highly accurate, efficient, and scalable. Additionally, we offer an API that allows developers and researchers to build on top of our models, enabling them to leverage the power of AI in their own projects and applications.

By offering a suite of AI models that are based on these core capabilities, we are committed to helping our users unlock new insights and achieve better outcomes in their work.

### Text Generation

The text generation model is a powerful tool that can be used to generate text based on a prompt.
The model is trained on a large corpus of text, and can be fine-tuned to generate text in a
specific style or domain. The model can be used to generate text in a variety of styles,
including news articles, blog posts, and even poetry. You can use the model to generate text
content for your website, or to generate text for your chatbot.

#### AiCon V2

The **AiCon V2** model is a powerful text generation model that can be used to generate text based
on a prompt. It is a language model based on the Bidirectional Encoder Representations from
Transformers architecture,
which helps us build a model that can generate text in a variety of styles. The model is trained with enhanced features and capabilities that make it an even more powerful tool for natural language processing.

One of the most significant advantages of **AiCon V2** is its ability to generate human-like
responses to natural language queries. This is made possible by the model's massive size, allowing it to understand and respond to a wide range of
language patterns and structures.

You can access it either from the dashboard, or you can build your own applications on top of it
using our API and
has many potential
applications in various
industries, including education, healthcare, finance, and more. It can be used to generate automated responses to customer queries, assist with natural language processing in scientific research, and even aid in language translation.

#### AiCon V3

**AiCon V3** is 10 times more advanced than its predecessor. This enhancement enables
the model to better understand context and distinguish nuances, resulting in more accurate and
coherent responses. For example, **AiCon V3** can recognize and respond sensitively to a user expressing sadness or frustration, making the interaction feel more personal and genuine.

While **AiCon V2** can generate creative content, **AiCon V3** goes a step further by producing stories, poems, or essays with improved coherence and creativity.

For example, **AiCon V3** can produce a short story with a well-developed plot and character development, whereas **AiCon V2** might struggle to maintain consistency and coherence in the narrative.

#### Content Moderation Model

The content moderation model is a powerful tool that can be used to detect inappropriate content in
text. It can be used to detect and remove offensive language, hate speech, and other inappropriate
content from your website or app. The model is trained on a large corpus of text, and can be
fine-tuned to detect specific types of content.

You can access it either from the dashboard to set it as a part of your Automated Workflow, or you
can build
your own
applications on top of it. It has many potential applications in various industries, including
education, healthcare, finance, and more. It can be used to detect and remove offensive language
from social media posts, detect and remove hate speech from online forums, and detect and remove
inappropriate content from online games.

### Image Generation

Generating images from text is a cutting-edge application of artificial intelligence and natural language processing that has captured the attention of researchers and technology enthusiasts alike. This exciting field involves training machine learning models to generate high-quality, photorealistic images based on textual descriptions. By interpreting and translating natural language descriptions into visual representations, these models have the potential to revolutionize fields such as advertising, e-commerce, and even art and design. In this field, researchers and developers are constantly exploring new techniques and algorithms to improve the accuracy and speed of these models, making it an exciting and rapidly evolving field in the realm of artificial intelligence.

You can access it either from the dashboard by signing up to your Workspace, or you can build your
own
applications on top of it.

#### ImageCon V2

The **ImageCon V2** model is a powerful image generation model that can be used to generate images
based on a text description. It is a generative adversarial network (GAN) that uses a
conditional generative adversarial network (cGAN) to generate images based on a text description.
The model is trained on a large corpus of images and text descriptions, and can be fine-tuned to
generate images in a specific style or domain.

ImageCon V2 also serves as the Base Model for a Lot of other Image Processing Capabilities that
include Image Enhancement, Image Classification, Image Search, Image Captioning, Image
Similarity, Moderation and many more. Due to it extensive labelling cpaabilities and its
training process over a corpus of millions of images, it is able to generate and detect
properties of images in a very accurate manner.

#### ImageCon V3

**ImageCon V3** is a highly advanced image generation model that represents a significant leap
forward from its predecessor, **ImageCon V2**. This enhanced model incorporates advanced techniques to improve its ability to understand context and nuances, resulting in more accurate and coherent image generation.

With **ImageCon V3**, users can create stunning, photorealistic images with greater coherence and creativity, using shorter prompts and generating words within images. Additionally, the model has greatly improved image composition and face generation capabilities, resulting in rich visuals and jaw-dropping aesthetics. The use of **ImageCon V3** enables users to generate legible text and sensitive responses to users' emotional expressions, resulting in a more personalized and genuine interaction. Overall, **ImageCon V3** is a significant advancement in the field of image generation, offering enhanced capabilities that are sure to impress users and transform the way they approach image creation.
