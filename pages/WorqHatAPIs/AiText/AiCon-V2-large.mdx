# AiCon V2 Large Model (Beta)

AiCon’s impressive conversational abilities are rooted in years of research and development. Like many advanced language models, such as BERT and GPT-3, AiCon is based on the Transformer neural network architecture, which was made publicly available in 2017. This architecture allows for the creation of models that can read multiple words (such as a sentence or paragraph) and understand the relationships between those words, thereby predicting what words will come next.

What sets AiCon apart from other language models is its unique training process. Unlike
traditional models, AiCon was trained on current web data upto March 2022, including actual
conversations.

This training allowed it to grasp the subtleties that make open-ended conversation and text distinct from other forms of language. One of these subtleties is sensibility - does the response match the conversational context and make sense?

Andd now we have gone a step further and increased the Word Size to 100,000 words in a
single request. You can now Train Your Data Earlier and get better results or pass a longer
training context to the model. Please note that this is a relatively new feature and may return
results that are not as accurate as the previous version. We are working on improving the
accuracy of the model and will be releasing updates soon.


<Callout type="warning" emoji="⚠️">
  Passing larger amount of Text Content directly to the model may result in a higher number of
  Word Processes and may take longer to process. We recommend that you use the Training Data
  field to pass your data to the model. When you pass the data to the model using the Training
  Data field, the model will process the data and cache it so that it is available for future
  requests. This will help you save time and costs on processing.
</Callout>

<Callout type="info" emoji="ℹ️">
  When you pass the data to the model using the Training Data field, you are only limited to 100,000 words. If you want to pass more than 100,000 words, you will have to pass the data
  directly to the model for training.

We are dedicated to revolutionizing the way organizations approach productivity, building applications and content generation. Our latest creation AiCon - the AI Content Optimization Network - has been developed to help organizations streamline their workflow and improve their overall output.

Developers can not only translate languages, summarize long documents, and answer
information-seeking questions, but they can also create comprehensive and engaging content in a
fraction of the time and cost it would take without the aid of artificial intelligence.

## Use Cases

- **Writing Assistance**: Content Generation APIs can help writers and authors by providing
suggestions, generating outlines, or even drafting entire paragraphs or articles based on given prompts. This can save time and enhance the writing process.

- **Marketing and Advertising**: AI-powered APIs can generate engaging and persuasive marketing copy, including ad slogans, social media posts, email campaigns, and product descriptions. This enables businesses to create compelling content that resonates with their target audience.

- **Personalized Content**: Content Generation APIs can assist in creating personalized content experiences by dynamically generating content tailored to individual users. This could include personalized product recommendations, news articles, or even customized emails.

- **Language Translation**: APIs can be used to automate language translation tasks, converting text from one language to another. This is particularly useful for websites, apps, or platforms that need to support multiple languages, enabling effective communication with a global audience.

- **Chatbots and Virtual Assistants**: AI-powered chatbots and virtual assistants leverage Content Generation APIs to provide human-like responses to user queries. These APIs enable the generation of natural language responses, enhancing the user experience and improving customer service.

- **Content Summarization**: APIs can automatically generate concise summaries of lengthy documents, articles, or reports. This is valuable for news aggregators, research platforms, or any application where users need quick access to the main points of a large body of text.

- **Data Visualization**: APIs can assist in generating visual representations of data, such as charts, graphs, or infographics, based on input datasets. This helps businesses and individuals present complex information in a more digestible and visually appealing manner.

- **Virtual Storytelling**: Content Generation APIs can be used in video game development or virtual reality experiences to dynamically generate storylines, dialogues, and narratives. This allows for immersive and interactive storytelling experiences that adapt to user actions and choices.

- **Content Curation**: APIs can automate the process of collecting and curating content from various sources, such as news articles, blog posts, or social media feeds. This helps content platforms deliver relevant and up-to-date information to their users.

- **E-commerce Product Descriptions**: AI-powered APIs can generate compelling and accurate
product descriptions by analyzing product features, specifications, and customer reviews. This assists e-commerce platforms in creating engaging content that drives conversions.

        "Thermax manufactures boilers to harness the power of steam. The company started with producing small, once-through, baby boilers to cater to the steam requirements at hospitals.[citation needed] It was established in 1966, when A. S. Bhathena collaborated with a Belgian company, Wanson, to commence business operations in Dadar, Mumbai, India as Wanson India Ltd., manufacturing small boilers.[3] On 15 February 1995 it became a public company on the Bombay Stock Exchange. It has, since long, been known simply as Thermax Limited.[citation needed] In 2009, it signed a 51–49 joint venture with US firm SPX Corporation to provide equipment and services for the Indian power sector.[4][5] In 2010, it signed a joint venture agreement with US-based Babcock & Wilcox to manufacture super-critical boilers for the power sector.[6]",
        "Google LLC is an American multinational technology company focusing on online advertising, search engine technology, cloud computing, computer software, quantum computing, e-commerce, artificial intelligence,[9] and consumer electronics. It has been referred to as the most powerful company in the world[10] and one of the world's most valuable brands due to its market dominance, data collection, and technological advantages in the area of artificial intelligence.[11][12][13] Its parent company Alphabet is considered one of the Big Five American information technology companies, alongside Amazon, Apple, Meta, and Microsoft. Google was founded on September 4, 1998, by computer scientists Larry Page and Sergey Brin while they were PhD students at Stanford University in California. Together they own about 14% of its publicly listed shares and control 56% of its stockholder voting power through super-voting stock. The company went public via an initial public offering (IPO) in 2004. In 2015, Google was reorganized as a wholly owned subsidiary of Alphabet Inc. Google is Alphabet's largest subsidiary and is a holding company for Alphabet's internet properties and interests. Sundar Pichai was appointed CEO of Google on October 24, 2015, replacing Larry Page, who became the CEO of Alphabet. On December 3, 2019, Pichai also became the CEO of Alphabet.[14] The company has since rapidly grown to offer a multitude of products and services beyond Google Search, many of which hold dominant market positions. These products address a wide range of use cases, including email (Gmail), navigation (Waze & Maps), cloud computing (Cloud), web browsing (Chrome), video sharing (YouTube), productivity (Workspace), operating systems (Android), cloud storage (Drive), language translation (Translate), photo storage (Photos), video calling (Meet), smart home (Nest), smartphones (Pixel), wearable technology (Pixel Watch & Fitbit), music streaming (YouTube Music), video on demand (YouTube TV), artificial intelligence (Google Assistant), machine learning APIs (TensorFlow), AI chips (TPU), and more. Discontinued Google products include gaming (Stadia), Glass, Google+, Reader, Play Music, Nexus, Hangouts, and Inbox by Gmail.[15][16] Google's other ventures outside of Internet services and consumer electronics include quantum computing (Sycamore), self-driving cars (Waymo, formerly the Google Self-Driving Car Project), smart cities (Sidewalk Labs), and transformer models (Google Brain).[17] Google and YouTube are the two most visited websites worldwide followed by Facebook and Twitter. Google is also the largest search engine, mapping and navigation application, email provider, office suite, video sharing platform, photo and cloud storage provider, mobile operating system, web browser, ML framework, and AI virtual assistant provider in the world as measured by market share. On the list of most valuable brands, Google is ranked second by Forbes[18] and fourth by Interbrand.[19] It has received significant criticism involving issues such as privacy concerns, tax avoidance, censorship, search neutrality, antitrust and abuse of its monopoly position."
