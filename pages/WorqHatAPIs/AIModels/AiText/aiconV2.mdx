# AiCon V2 (Content Generation AI)

AiCon’s impressive conversational abilities are rooted in years of research and development. Like many advanced language models, such as BERT and GPT-3, AiCon is based on the Transformer neural network architecture, which was made publicly available in 2017. This architecture allows for the creation of models that can read multiple words (such as a sentence or paragraph) and understand the relationships between those words, thereby predicting what words will come next.

What sets AiCon apart from other language models is its unique training process. Unlike traditional models, AiCon was trained on current web data, including actual conversations. This training allowed it to grasp the subtleties that make open-ended conversation and text distinct from other forms of language. One of these subtleties is sensibility - does the response match the conversational context and make sense?

We are dedicated to revolutionizing the way organizations approach productivity, building applications and content generation. Our latest creation AiCon - the AI Content Optimization Network - has been developed to help organizations streamline their workflow and improve their overall output.

Developers can not only translate languages, summarize long documents, and answer
information-seeking questions, but they can also create comprehensive and engaging content in a
fraction of the time and cost it would take without the aid of artificial intelligence.

## Use Cases

- **Writing Assistance**: Content Generation APIs can help writers and authors by providing
suggestions, generating outlines, or even drafting entire paragraphs or articles based on given prompts. This can save time and enhance the writing process.

- **Marketing and Advertising**: AI-powered APIs can generate engaging and persuasive marketing copy, including ad slogans, social media posts, email campaigns, and product descriptions. This enables businesses to create compelling content that resonates with their target audience.

- **Personalized Content**: Content Generation APIs can assist in creating personalized content experiences by dynamically generating content tailored to individual users. This could include personalized product recommendations, news articles, or even customized emails.

- **Language Translation**: APIs can be used to automate language translation tasks, converting text from one language to another. This is particularly useful for websites, apps, or platforms that need to support multiple languages, enabling effective communication with a global audience.

- **Chatbots and Virtual Assistants**: AI-powered chatbots and virtual assistants leverage Content Generation APIs to provide human-like responses to user queries. These APIs enable the generation of natural language responses, enhancing the user experience and improving customer service.

- **Content Summarization**: APIs can automatically generate concise summaries of lengthy documents, articles, or reports. This is valuable for news aggregators, research platforms, or any application where users need quick access to the main points of a large body of text.

- **Data Visualization**: APIs can assist in generating visual representations of data, such as charts, graphs, or infographics, based on input datasets. This helps businesses and individuals present complex information in a more digestible and visually appealing manner.

- **Virtual Storytelling**: Content Generation APIs can be used in video game development or virtual reality experiences to dynamically generate storylines, dialogues, and narratives. This allows for immersive and interactive storytelling experiences that adapt to user actions and choices.

- **Content Curation**: APIs can automate the process of collecting and curating content from various sources, such as news articles, blog posts, or social media feeds. This helps content platforms deliver relevant and up-to-date information to their users.

- **E-commerce Product Descriptions**: AI-powered APIs can generate compelling and accurate
product descriptions by analyzing product features, specifications, and customer reviews. This assists e-commerce platforms in creating engaging content that drives conversions.

## How to use it?

### API Endpoint

````bash filename="API Endpoint" copy
https://api.worqhat.com/api/ai/content/v2
````

### Headers


| Header Name |  Required  | Description |
|:---------| :------------: | :---------------- |
| x-api-key| ``true`` | This helps us to identify the User Sending the Request |
| x-org-key|  ``true`` | This helps us to identify the Workspace Associated with the Request. This helps users to maintain easier logs |

### Request Body

The Request Body is a JSON Object that contains the following fields:

| Data Type | Key | Value | Description |
|:---------| :------------: | :---------------- | :---------------- |
| String | question (required) | ``<Any Question that you want to pass to the model>`` | The question you want to ask the AI |
| Boolean | preserve_history (optional) | ``true`` or ``false`` | Whether you want to preserve the history of the conversation or not. If you set this to ``true``, you will have to pass the ``history_object`` field as well. |
| Object | history_object (optional) | ``{}`` | This is the history object that you want to pass to the model. This is only required if you set ``preserve_history`` to ``true``. |
| String | training_data (optional) | ``<Any Training Data that you want to pass to the model>`` | The training data you want to pass to the AI. The AI will answer on the basis of your Data.|
| Float | randomness (optional) | ``0.0`` to ``1.0`` | This is the randomness factor that you want to pass to the model. This is only required if you want to set the randomness factor. Default is ``0.9``. |

````json filename="Request Body (Formdata)" copy
{
    "question": "Hi, who built you?",
    "preserve_history": true,
    "history_object": {
        "Hi, who are you?": "My name is WorqBot, nice to meet you!"
    },
    "randomness": 0.4
}
````

#### History Object

The History Object is a JSON Object that contains the following fields:

| Data Type | Key | Value | Description |
|:---------| :------------: | :---------------- | :---------------- |
| String | ``<User Question or Response>`` | ``<Associated AI Response or Question>`` | The question or response that you want to pass to the model. The AI will answer on the basis of your Data. |

````json filename="History Object" copy
{
    "Hi, who are you?(User) ": "My name is WorqBot, nice to meet you! (AI)",
    "Who built you?(User)": "I was built by WorqHat, a company that is dedicated to revolutionizing the way organizations approach productivity, building applications and content generation. (AI)"
}
````


### Sample Code

You can use the following Endpoints on any Codebase, including client side codebases as long as
you are able to send the Headers and the Request Body to the API Endpoint. It's that easy! Just
send a POST Request to the API Endpoint with the Headers and the Request Body, and you are good to go!

<Callout type="warning" emoji="⚠️">
  Please note that the **AiCon V2 Model** has a word capacity limit of 4000 words in a single
  request including maintaining history and adding training data. If you exceed this limit, you
  will get an error.
