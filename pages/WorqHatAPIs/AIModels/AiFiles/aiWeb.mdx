# AI to Extract Content from Web Pages

With the growing amount of information on the internet, it can be overwhelming to manually extract and process relevant data from web pages. This is where AI-powered content extraction comes in handy. Content extraction is the process of automatically identifying and extracting relevant information from web pages, such as text, images, and tables, and converting them into structured data that can be easily analyzed and processed. AI-powered content extraction algorithms use machine learning and natural language processing techniques to understand the layout and structure of a web page and extract the most relevant and useful content. This technology has numerous applications, from automated data mining and research to e-commerce and customer analytics.

## How does it work?


Web Extract AI works by using machine learning algorithms to analyze the structure and content of web pages. The algorithm is trained on a large dataset of web pages to learn how to recognize and extract relevant information. It uses natural language processing techniques to understand the semantic meaning of the text and the relationship between different elements on the page. The algorithm can identify important elements such as headlines, paragraphs, images, and tables and extract them into a structured format such as JSON. It can also clean and normalize the extracted data to make it easier to analyze and process. The result is a structured dataset that can be used for a wide range of applications, including data mining, research, and analysis. AI-powered content extraction is a powerful tool for organizations looking to gain insights from the vast amount of data available on the web.

## Use Cases

Here are some potential use cases for AI-powered content extraction:

- **Market research**: AI-powered content extraction can help businesses gather and analyze information about competitors, industry trends, and customer sentiment. By automatically extracting data from a large number of sources, businesses can gain insights into market opportunities and make informed decisions.

- **E-commerce**: Product information extraction is a popular use case for AI-powered content extraction in e-commerce. By automatically extracting product information from manufacturer websites, businesses can quickly create comprehensive product catalogs and keep them up-to-date.

- **News aggregation**: AI-powered content extraction can be used to automatically gather and summarize news articles from multiple sources. This can be useful for media companies looking to keep up with breaking news or for individuals who want to stay informed on a particular topic.

- **Social media monitoring**: AI-powered content extraction can be used to monitor social media platforms for mentions of a particular brand or topic. This can help businesses track their reputation, identify customer needs and concerns, and respond to customer inquiries and complaints in a timely manner.

- **Academic research**: Researchers can use AI-powered content extraction to gather and analyze information from a large number of academic papers and publications. This can help researchers identify trends, gaps in knowledge, and potential research topics.

### API Endpoint

```bash filename="API Endpoint" copy
https://api.worqhat.com/api/ai/v2/web-extract
```

### Headers


| Header Name |  Required  | Description |
|:---------| :------------: | :---------------- |
| x-api-key| ``true`` | This helps us to identify the User Sending the Request |
| x-org-key|  ``true`` | This helps us to identify the Workspace Associated with the Request. This helps users to maintain easier logs |

### Request Body

The Request Body is a JSON Object. The JSON Object has the following fields :

| Data Type |    Key    | Value | Description                           |
|:---------|:---------:| :---------------- |:--------------------------------------|
| String | url_path (required) | `<url>` | The path to the WebPage (Localhost / Online) |
| Boolean | headline (optional) |  `true` or `false` | Whether to extract the Headline or not |
| Boolean | inline_code (optional) |  `true` or `false` | Whether to extract the Inline Code or not |
| Boolean | code_block (optional) |  `true` or `false` | Whether to extract the Code Block or not |
| Boolean | tables (optional) |  `true` or `false` | Whether to extract the Table or not |
| Boolean | references (optional) |  `true` or `false` | Whether to extract the References or not |



```json filename="Request Body (JSON)" copy
{
    "url_path": "<url>",
    "headline": false,
    "inline_code" : false,
    "code_blocks" : true,
    "references" : false,
    "tables" : false
}
```

### Sample Code

You can use the following Endpoints on any Codebase, including client side codebases as long as
you are able to send the Headers and the Request Body to the API Endpoint.
It's that easy!
Just
send a POST Request to the API Endpoint with the Headers and the Request Body,
and you are good to go!
