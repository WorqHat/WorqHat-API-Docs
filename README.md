Welcome to WorqHat's Public API documentation. This documentation was built to help you build your
own custom integration with WorqHat's REST-based Application Programming Interface (API).

The **WorqHatAPI** can be applied to virtually any task that you want to perform on the WorqHat
Applications but from your own codebases. This involves understanding or generating natural
language, code, images and voices; adding in custom form data to the records and even making changes
to the No-Code Applications.

The WorqHat AI API is a versatile tool that can be used for a wide range of tasks involving natural
language, code, and images. Our API provides various models with varying power levels, suitable for
different tasks, and can be trained on the fly while generating outputs. With the flexibility to
handle content generation, semantic search, and classification, our API offers a comprehensive
solution for your needs.
